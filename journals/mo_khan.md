## Jan 4th 2023
- As a team we shared our repo setup and made sure live-sharing within VS code was working.
- We discussed which database would probably work best for us between MongoDB and Postgres-SQL.

## Jan 5th 2023

- We started work on our docker.compose.yaml file, the requirements.txt file, and worked on the base template.
- we created some tables and made migrations.

## Jan 6th 2023

- Worked on router and query files as well as testing them with the FastAPI swagger framework.
-Worked mostly on authentication for login with a token as well as logout functionality.

## Jan 9th 2023

-Continued work on the protected router and all reminaing CRUD functaionality in terms of leaving reviews by signed in users.
-Created router and query files for the 3rd party imported API, OMDB.
-Discussed how much fuinctionality we wanted to just leave for the frontend in regards to editing and deleting a review.
-Need to work on some of our response codes - aiming to do so tomorrow.

## Jan 10th 2023

-Updated response codes so that they are functional and improved functionality on the user function.
-Discussed the pros/cons as well as "is there really a need for" React vs Redux and decided we would not use Redux.
-Started work on frontend authentication and token but still are having some issues.

## Jan 11th 2023

-Are now able to implement authentication on the frontend and able to login with a modal. Worked on the navbar and looked at how we could implement bootstrap functionality. Login and logout within the modal are working fine.

## Jan 12th 2023

-With code prepped by Gavin before hand, we finishe dthe sign up modal.
-Completed fuinctionality so that the signup modal would directly let the user login after submission.
-Fixed the home page so that a few movies and their cards would show up and added a search bar to find other movies. The cards also link to an indivdiual movie page where users can read reviews and if signed in, they can leave reviews themselves.

## Jan 13th 2023

-Attempted to create edit and delete buttons in the reviews of a signed in user.
-The edit button was suppposed to open up a modal but we ran into some issues there and ultimately decied to move away from that idea.

## Jan 17th 2023

-Gavin had worked on some new implementations on the edit and delete buttons, moving away from bootstrap and instead going back to css/html.
-We added error messages and limitations to the reviews, login, signup, and search bar.
-We plan on working on tests tomorrow but it seems like we have a mostly completed implementation from our original vision on the excalidraw.

## Jan 18th 2023

-Each of us designed tests for the project and troubleshooted as a group when any of us would come across any issues.
-Started to lay out a favorites router, query, and modal in our dream branch as we start to work towards stretch goals. We want to eventually create a user page which links certain
