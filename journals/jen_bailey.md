## Jan 6

Today we worked on:
We created a router and query file for users and tested the api calls in swagger.
We spent the rest of the day working on the the authentication. We managed to get the authentication working and tested that we could log in with a token and logout successfully.

## Jan 9

Today we worked on:
We created the protected routers for all the crud functions for reviews and the reviews queries. We created the router and queries for our 3rd party api OMDB.
We experimented with protecting the edit review to only be edited by the user that created the view. We managed to get that working but did not manage to get it to work for the delete function. We discussed handling this on the front end.
We realized that out response codes are not working so are going to fix that tomorrow along with starting the front end with react.
