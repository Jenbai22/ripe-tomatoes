Today, I worked on:

1. As a team we worked on getting our repo shared to each member of the team.
2. We also spent time reading over Learn to see if we will pick MongolDB or SQL for our backend.

Today, I worked on:

1. Today we did team coding and completed the yaml file. It appears to be working as we were able as Docker seems to be running.
2. I have run into an issue of one of my containers is not working. I have tried working with SEIRs and my teammates. Google has been a huge rabbit hole. I will call it a night and will try to find a solution tmw when I am better rested.
